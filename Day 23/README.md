# Day 23

I just "brute-forced" the simulation for today. It only took 970 turns (and about 1 second to of runtime) for my simulation to come to an end. I didn't end up needing to utilize anything fancy like caching or what have you.

Also, `unordered_map` and `unordered_set` are very connivent. I don't know if it's an optimal solution, or performant to rely off them, but they did make today's challenge much easier.
