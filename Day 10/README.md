# Day Ten

Today was pretty simple.

I originally thought that cycles could occur in parallel (with a cycle increment every line), so I made an array of the register at different cycle times. Eventually I did realize my error, but by then I already had a system that worked well, so I kept it and solved part 1.

For part 2, I was thankful that I had kept track of the registers in the way that I did. While it probably isn't as space efficient as it could be, it did make the second part of the problem quite easy.
