# Day Fourteen

Today's challenge was a pretty simple simulation.

For part 1 I just made a 2D character array of 1000x1000 cells and simulated the falling sand.

For part 2 I erased all the sand and added the floor line (I already had a floor variable for part 1's end condition), and then simulated the sand again with a new end condition.
