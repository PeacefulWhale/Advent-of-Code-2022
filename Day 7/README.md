# Day Seven

Today I spent most of my time creating the directory hierarchy from the input file.

Once I had that, solving the problem was quite easy. I used recursion for both part 1 and part 2.

I used vectors because I was too lazy to handle dynamic arrays. I originally too lazy to set up a newer standard of C++ on my intellisense / compiler so I didn't use any of the fancy `auto x : vector` stuff... but then I decided to actually put in some miniscule amount of effort to make the code prettier. Adding `c++20` to my intellisense settings wasn't as difficult as I feared it would be.
