# Day Three

Today's was pretty simple. The first part was just finding matching characters within two halves of a line and adding them up. The second part was the same as the first part, but across 3 entire lines.

I didn't do anything fancy, I read and then looped through the lines until I got a match. I think that C++ has a `find` function, but a for loop works as well so why bother?
