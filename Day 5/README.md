# Day Five

Today I just used stacks to "simulate" this magical `CrateMover 9000` and `CrateMover 9001`. For part one I just pushed directly onto the stacks, and for part two I pushed onto a temp stack, and then popped it to get the elements in the right order.

Honestly figuring out how to parse the input took longer than completing the rest of the code.
