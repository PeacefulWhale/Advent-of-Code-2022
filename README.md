# Advent of Code 2022

Last year I did this challenge with C. This year I've decided to do it in Python / C++.

For simpler challenges, I'll probably utilize Python, but for more complex challenges I'll aim to utilize C++ to further my skills with it.

The challenges are available [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/).

01. [Day 1 Writeup](./Day%201/README.md), [Code](./Day%201/day1.py)
02. [Day 2 Writeup](./Day%202/README.md), [Code](./Day%202/day2.cpp), [Alternative Code](./Day%202/day2_alternative.cpp)
03. [Day 3 Writeup](./Day%203/README.md), [Code](./Day%203/day3.cpp)
